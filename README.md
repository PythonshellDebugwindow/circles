# Circles!

This is an implementation of Circles which is a yet to be implemented graphical esolang created by [PythonshellDebugwindow](https://github.com/PythonshellDebugwindow).

I think this is a nice esolang so I'm gonna implement this.

# Thoughts on standards

I don't think you really need to have standards since it's entirely possible to detect circles of any size with opencv
