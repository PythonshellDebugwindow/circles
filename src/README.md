~~Not a~~ Almost no chance.

Currently "trying" to make an interpreter on my computer.

# Implementation and the Circles Standard Scale
In order to make an interpreter (or compiler) for Circles, I have realized that some sort of standard is in order. This is the Circles Standard Scale (CSS).

## The standard
The standard states that Circles programs must have 20px of non-white margin on all sides, and that all paths must be exactly 107 pixels in length. It also states that all paths must only be at an 0째, 90째, 180째, or 270째 angle.
