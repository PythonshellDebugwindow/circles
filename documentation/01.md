# 1. Introduction
Circles is an esoteric programming language, meaning it's a programming language that was created not in seriousness, but just for fun. Unlike more traditional languages, whose programs are text files, Circles programs are image files. This is because a program in Circles looks like a maze of nested circles, connected by parallel lines who themselves contain circles.

# 1.1 Types of circles
There are two types of circles in Circles: *normal circles* and *start circles*.
